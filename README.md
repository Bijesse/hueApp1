###Errors

**8/2/16**  
While on Home network I am recieving the following error on my webapp (http://i.imgur.com/KTvNTaA.png).

However, when I place `https://192.168.1.2/api/OGIOGrBPRyn1AutXp3tLkZFIbMETdMaUCIBBkCL7/lights` straight into the browser I recieve the JSON endpoint I am looking for (http://i.imgur.com/G9Qox3j.png).  

This is leading me to believe that there is an issue with my .ajax call but I am unsure how.
